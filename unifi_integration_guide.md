### 2. üéôÔ∏è VOICE-CONTROLLED CAMERA SYSTEM

#### Voice Commands for Your Cameras
```python
# Add to your HA bridge
CAMERA_COMMANDS = {
    "show me the front door": "camera.doorbell_main_entrance",
    "check the driveway": "camera.front_lt_driveway",
    "show backyard": "camera.back_rt_facing_patio",
    "garage camera": "camera.garage_camera",
    "show all cameras": "group.all_cameras"
}

def handle_camera_commands(command):
    for phrase, camera in CAMERA_COMMANDS.items():
        if phrase in command.lower():
            return {
                "service": "camera.turn_on",
                "entity_id": camera,
                "response": f"Displaying {phrase}"
            }
```
