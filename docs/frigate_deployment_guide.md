# Object Detection Configuration
objects:
  track:
    - person
    - car
    - truck
    - bicycle
    - motorcycle
    - dog
    - cat
    - package  # Custom detection for deliveries
  filters:
    person:
      min_area: 2500
      max_area: 100000
      threshold: 0.75
      min_score: 0.60
    car:
      min_area: 15000
      max_area: 200000
      threshold: 0.70
    package:
      min_area: 1000
      max_area: 50000
      threshold: 0.65

# Recording Configuration
record:
  enabled: true
  retain:
    days: 7
    mode: active_objects
  events:
    retain:
      default: 7
      mode: motion
```

### Step 3: Getting Camera Stream URLs

You'll need to get the RTSP stream URLs from your Unifi Protect system:

1. **Access Unifi Protect Console**
2. **Go to Camera Settings** for each camera
3. **Find RTSP Stream URLs** (usually in Advanced settings)
4. **Note the stream IDs** for each camera

Typical format: `rtsp://192.168.0.XXX:7447/[STREAM_ID]`

### Step 4: Proxmox Deployment

```bash
# On your Proxmox host
mkdir -p /opt/frigate
cd /opt/frigate

# Create docker-compose.yml with the configuration above
# Create config directory
mkdir -p config storage

# Deploy Frigate
docker-compose up -d
```

## üéôÔ∏è VOICE COMMAND INTEGRATION

Once Frigate is running, we'll enhance your voice system with AI queries:

### New Voice Commands You'll Have:
- **"Any people at the front door?"**
- **"Show me recent motion events"**
- **"Was there a package delivered?"**
- **"Any cars in the driveway today?"**
- **"Show me all person detections"**

### Enhanced Camera Commands:
- **"Show front door with recent alerts"**
- **"Check driveway for vehicles"**
- **"Any motion in the backyard?"**

## üì± SMART NOTIFICATIONS

Frigate will enable intelligent alerts:

```yaml
# Home Assistant automation examples
- alias: "Package Delivered Alert"
  trigger:
    platform: mqtt
    topic: frigate/events
  condition:
    condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.payload_json.type == 'package' }}"
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app
      data:
        title: "üì¶ Package Delivered"
        message: "Package detected at {{ trigger.payload_json.camera }}"

- alias: "Person at Door"
  trigger:
    platform: mqtt
    topic: frigate/front_door/person
  action:
    - service: tts.speak
      data:
        message: "Someone is at the front door"
```

## üîß RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

For your Proxmox setup:
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores dedicated to Frigate
- **RAM**: 4-8GB (depending on number of cameras)
- **Storage**: 500GB+ for recordings
- **Network**: Good bandwidth to handle 5 camera streams

## üìä EXPECTED BENEFITS

### Before Frigate:
- Basic camera recording
- Manual review of footage
- Generic motion alerts

### After Frigate:
- **Smart person detection**: "John arrived home"
- **Package alerts**: "Delivery at front door"
- **Vehicle tracking**: "Unknown car in driveway"
- **Zone-based monitoring**: "Motion in restricted area"
- **AI search**: "Show all people from yesterday"

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

You'll know Frigate is working when:
1. ‚úÖ All 5 cameras show detection zones in Frigate UI
2. ‚úÖ Person detection events appear in real-time
3. ‚úÖ Voice commands return AI-powered responses
4. ‚úÖ Smart notifications only for relevant events
5. ‚úÖ Searchable AI event database

Your Unifi cameras will transform from passive recording to intelligent monitoring!
